You can be assessed charge-backs for: (i) customer disputes; (ii) unauthorized or improperly authorized transactions; (iii) transactions that do not comply with payment processor network rules or are allegedly unlawful or suspicious; or (iv) any reversals for any reason by our payment processor or the institutions handling the transaction.
